        <h1>Obesity: The Epidemic of America</h1>
        <h4 style="color: rgb(201, 146, 249);">By Jason Tee, Carter Ogden, Albar Shahnoor, & Joy Son</h4>
        <br><br>
        <p>Obesity was first introduced in history as a result of the technological advances from the 18th century. 
            These advances gradually became the indicator for an overabundance of easy access food as well as decreased 
            physical activity. In the latter half of the 19th century, weight began to be stigmatized for beauty standards and in the 20th century,
            the association between weight and increased health risk was recognized.</p>
        <p>As of 2016, according to WHO, 650 million adults worldwide were obese. Among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
            countries, the U.S. holds the <font size="5">highest percentage </font> of obese adults.

        <h2>Obesity Rates in the U.S. by Age</h2><br>
        <div class="content-container">
            <p class="agetext">After experiencing a spike in the 1980s, the U.S. has been on a steadily increasing <font size="5">upper trend </font>in obesity.
            Additionally, obesity rates are significantly increasing in every age group, from as young as 2 years old to older than 60 years of age. This raises a concern
        regarding childhood obesity as it is a strong indicator for adulthood obesity, premature death, and disability. The primary causes of childhood obesity are:<br>
        <br><font size="4"> - Genetics</font> (*does not predetermine obesity)
        <br><font size="4"> - Engineered Junk Food</font>

        <h2>Rates of obesity and other chronic illnesses in counties in New York State</h2><br>
          <p>From the data, we notice some patterns. First, overweight and obesity rates are quite high for students.
              Second, the spread for angina/heart disease diagnosis is fairly narrow while it is very high 
              for participation rates in leisure time exercise. Third, the general outline for disease rates correspond i.e. the bumps
          in the data segments align with each other e.g. angina and overweight adults.</p><br>

        <h2> Obesity Indicators in New York State</h2>
        <br>
            <p>As we can see from the data, obesity rates range widely across the state of New York, appearing anywhere from 28% to over 40% in certain counties.
                Counties in the northern and western parts of the state tend to experience higher rates of obesity, likely attributed to their lower average income
                and increased proximity to grocery stores and fresh food.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Obesity is also a disease that has a number of indicators directly tied to the obesity rate. Some of the more prevalent ones as seen below include
                diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Cases of these diseases can be tied directly into higher obesity rates. For example, the data shows that in 
                King's County (Brooklyn) New York, there have been over 900,000 instances between 2008 and 2012 of diseases that could be indicators of obesity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, despite having 50,000 less residents, Erie County has had nearly 30,000 more cases of disease that are indicators of obesity in this time
                span. Once again, this can likely be attributed to income and proximity to grocery stores and healthy food options, both of which Westchester County has
                a significant advantage over Erie County in.
