        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <a href="index.html"><button>Project Page </button></a>
        <p>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our team had four members–Jason, Joy, Carter, Albar–who were each responsible for at least one visualization. Jason made
                the first vis (in d3), Joy the second, Albar the third (both in vega-lite), and Carter the last three (in tableau). We
                also equally divided the non-coding components of the project during the various project checkpoints. For example, each
                of us found two different users for the user-study. We therefore tried to keep the workload fairly even across the
                group. Additionally, we were able to conduct numerous team meetings to collaborate on different elements of the project
                and ask each other questions. Whenever possible, these were done in the library on campus to make it easier to help each
                other with aspects of the code, or the project in general. Over break, we were able to meet virtually on zoom which also
                helped us as we were able to share screens and digitally work together on the Github repository.
                <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Our design processes meant a lot of experimentation at first before narrowing down to a few visualizations that we
                liked. At first, we sketched about eight diagrams. From these, we picked a few which we liked and discarded the rest. We
                sketched a few more new visualizations, which we ended up choosing as well. After finalizing which visualizations we
                wanted, we got to work in our preferred vis languages. Here, the quirks/constraints of our coding language required that
                we reformat the data so that it was more code-friendly. Additionally, our design process was definitely influenced by
                the data that was available to us. We were able to locate around 4 datasets that provided insightful, and relatively
                complete data regarding different aspects of the obesity crisis. From the data we deduced the most feasible, but also
                the most insightful visualizations possible. Another key element of our design process was the user study, and getting
                feedback from users. Being able to get a number of unbiased and unfiltered perspectives on our work gave us great
                feedback that we were able to use to improve our website for all users. We compared feedback from each user study we
                individually conducted, and were able to come up with some key takeaways that we could use to make changes to our
                website.
                <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As suggested above, our data processing almost entirely entailed revising the format of the dataset. For instance, in
                its original form, the ‘Percentage/Rate’ section was very unwieldy. For some points, it contained probabilities which
                exceeded 100, requiring us to look into the documentation and adjust accordingly. As a result, we got all of the points
                to not exceed 100, unlike before. This then allowed us to code unobstructed and to finish the project. The data was also
                incomplete at times, which made it difficult to use one dataset for all of our needs. Because of this, as mentioned
                earlier, we had to locate numerous datasets to tell a complete story about our problem. Additionally due to the
                magnitude of some of the datasets, extensive filtering was required at times to include only relevant data to the given
                visualization/section of the project.
